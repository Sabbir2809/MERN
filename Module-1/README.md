## Module-1: Beginning JavaScript-1

1. **JS Introduction:**

   - JavaScript is a light-weight programming language which is used for web

1. **JS Comments:**

   - The JS comments are meaningful way to deliver message. It is used to add information about the code, warnings or suggestions. The JS comment
     is ignored by the JS engine

1. **JS Variables:**

   - A JS variable is simply a name of storage location
   - Name must start with a letter (a to z || A to Z), Underscore(\_), or dollar ($) sign
   - after first letter we can use digits (0 to 9)
   - JS variables are case sensitive, for example v and V are different variables

1. **Data Types:**

   - **Primitive:** String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined
   - **Non-Primitive:** Object, Array, Function

1. **JS Operators:**

   - JS operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
   - **Arithmetic:** +, -, \*, /, %, ++, --
   - **Comparison:** ==, ===, !=, !==, >, >=, <, <=
   - **Bitwise:** &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
   - **Logical:** &&, ||, !
   - **Assignment:** =, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=

1. **Conditions:**

   - The JS if-else statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false
   - if(only one condition), if-else(two condition), if-else if (more than two condition)

1. **Loop:**

   - The JS loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do-while, for-in and for-of loops.
   - for, for-in, for-of, while, do-while

1. **Functions:** JS functions are used to perform operations. We can call JS function many time to reuse the code.

   - Code Reusability
   - Less Code
   - Easy to Understand

1. **Objects:**

   - A JS object is an entity having state & behavior (properties & method)
   - for-in loop
   - key value pairs

1. **Array:** JS array is an object that represents a collection of similar type of elements

   - for-of loop
   - concat() -> method combines two or more arrays & returns a new string
   - from() -> method creates a new array that holds the shallow copy from an array or iterable object
   - filter() -> method filter & extract the element of an array that satisfying the provided condition
   - find() -> method returns the first element of the given array that satisfies the provided function condition

   -findIndex() -> method returns the index of first element of the given array that satisfies the provided function condition. It return -1 if no element satisfies the condition

   - forEach() -> method is used to invoke the specified function once for each array element
   - includes() -> method checks whether the given array contains the specified element. It returns true if an array contains the element, otherwise false
   - indexOf() -> method is used to search the position of a particular element in a given array (case-sensitive)
   - push() -> method add one or more elements to the end of the given array
   - pop() -> method removes the last element from the given array and return that element
   - reverse() -> method changes the sequence of elements of the given array and returns the reverse sequence
   - slice( start, end ) -> method extracts the part of the given array & returns it. doesn't change the original array.
   - splice( index, deleteCount , add) -> method is used to add/remove the elements from the existing array. It also modifies the original array.
   - length ->

1. **String:** The JS string is an object that represents a sequence of characters.

   - charAt() -> It provides the character value present at the specified index
   - concat() -> It provides a combination of two or more string
   - indexOf() -> It provides the position of a character value present in the given string
   - lastIndexOf() -> It provides the position of a character value present in the given string by searching a character from the last position
   - replace() ->
   - subString() ->
   - slice() ->
   - toUpperCase() ->
   - toLowerCase() ->
   - trim() ->
   - length ->

1. **Date Object:**

   - Date()
   - getFullYear()
   - getHours()
   - getMonth()
   - getTime()

1. **Math Methods:**

   - Math.abs()
   - Math.max()
   - Math.min()
   - Math.floor()
   - Math.ceil()
   - Math.round()
   - Math.random()
   - Math.PI
   - Math.sqrt()

1. **Number Methods:**
   - toFixed()
   - toString()
   - parseInt()
   - parseFloat()
   - isInteger()
