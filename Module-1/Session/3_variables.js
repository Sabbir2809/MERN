// x, y & result variables
var x = 10;
var y = 20;

let result = x + y;
console.log(result);

// Good variable names:
var firstName = 'Sabbir';
var lastName = 'Hossain';
var numItems = 2809;
var userLoggedIn = false;

// In JavaScript, naming conventions for variables are not strict, but it's important to follow certain best practices to make your code readable and maintainable. Here are some common conventions for naming variables in JavaScript:

// 1. Use descriptive names: Choose names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable.This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.

// 2. Use camelCase: When naming variables, use camelCase, which means the first word is lowercase and subsequent words are capitalized.This convention is widely used in JavaScript.

// 3. Avoid using reserved words: JavaScript has reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, such as "if", "else", and "while".Make sure to avoid using these words as variable names to prevent errors.

// 4. Use meaningful abbreviations: If a variable name is too long, you can use meaningful abbreviations to make it shorter while still maintaining its clarity.

// 5. Use consistent naming: Use consistent naming conventions throughout your code to make it easier to read and understand.For example, if you use camelCase for variable names, use it consistently across all your variables.
