### Part 2: CSS Properties, Selectors, and Rules

**Apply CSS styling to the HTML page created in Part 1 using the following requirements:**

- Set a custom font for all text on the page.
- Style the heading with a different color, font size, and alignment.
- Apply different background colors to the container div and the table.
- Set a specific width and height for the container div.
- Add a border around the table cells with a different color and border width.
- Apply a hover effect to the table rows, changing their background color.
- Use CSS selectors and specificity to style specific elements:

### Part 3: CSS Variables, Pseudo-classes, and Box Model

**Define and use CSS variables to control styling:**
