### Module-12: React Hooks, State Management & Routing

- React Hook is a feature in the React library that allows developers to use state and other React features in functional components, which were previously only available in class components.

- It was introduced in React version 16.8 Hooks can be used to manage state, handle side effects, and access lifecycle methods in functional components.

- There are several built-in Hooks provided by React, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef.

- React Hooks have greatly simplified the development process in React and have made it easier to write reusable and composable code.
