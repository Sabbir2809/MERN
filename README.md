### Module-12: React Hooks, State Management & Routing

- React Hook is a feature in the React library that allows developers to use state and other React features in functional components, which were previously only available in class components.

- It was introduced in React version 16.8 Hooks can be used to manage state, handle side effects, and access lifecycle methods in functional components.

- There are several built-in Hooks provided by React, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef.

- React Hooks have greatly simplified the development process in React and have made it easier to write reusable and composable code.

### Module-13: React-Redux

### 1.1 What is Redux & why Redux?

- A small JS Library
- for managing medium/large amount of states globally in your app.
- useContext + useReducer Hook ideas will help you to understand redux.

### 1.2 Some common terms related to redux

- **react-redux:** redux is used with some common packages such as react-redux
- **redux-toolkit:** recommended way to write redux logic for building redux app easily and avoiding mistakes.
- **redux devtools extension:** helps to debug redux app easily.

### 1.3 How Redux works?

- Define state.
- Dispatch an Action.
- Reducer update state based on Action Type.
- Store will update the view
